## 💡 Actionable Insights from Warehouse Data Analysis

---

### 📦 1. Zone C Bottleneck in Inbound Handling  
> Inbound shipments to **Zone C** consistently exceed capacity, especially for **Accessories** and **Footwear**.  
✅ **Action:** Reallocate SKUs using dynamic slotting. Offload to Zones A/B to reduce congestion.

---

### ⏳ 2. Delayed Fulfillment in High-Demand SKUs  
> Orders for **Accessories** and **Footwear** often exceed **5 hours** to fulfill.  
✅ **Action:** Optimize pick-pack workflows with zone/batch picking methods.

---

### 🚧 3. Zone B Sluggish Pick-Pack-Ship  
> **Zone B** regularly shows slower order handling despite moderate volume.  
✅ **Action:** Review zone layout and streamline workflows or automation.

---

### 🚦 4. Underutilized Warehouse Capacity  
> Storage utilization drops to **~37%** during non-peak periods, especially for **Apparel** and **Footwear**.  
✅ **Action:** Consolidate space and plan SKU rotation or seasonal intake.

---

### 📈 5. Inbound–Outbound Mismatch Causing Overstock  
> High inbound volumes (e.g., **Sportswear**) with stagnant outbound movement result in stockpile buildup.  
✅ **Action:** Sync procurement with demand forecasting to avoid dead stock.

---

### 🧭 6. Inventory Surges Without Turnover  
> Example: **Apparel** rose from 3,640 → 4,991 units in a day without outbound flow.  
✅ **Action:** Enable stock aging dashboards and alert mechanisms.

---

### ⚠️ 7. High Idle Time in XYZ Zones  
> Prolonged idle periods observed in specific warehouse sections.  
✅ **Action:** Reassign labor and explore automation in material handling.

---

### 🏷️ 8. Overstock–Understock Cycles for SKU-128  
> Repeated fluctuation in inventory for **SKU-128** impacts service level.  
✅ **Action:** Calibrate reorder points with real-time demand triggers.

---

### 🚚 9. Weekend Dispatch Delays  
> Significant delays observed in dispatches on **Saturdays & Sundays**.  
✅ **Action:** Adjust shift schedules or renegotiate terms with logistics partners.
